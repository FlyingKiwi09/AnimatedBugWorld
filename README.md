# AnimatedBugWorld

JAVAFX game developed for an assignment during my Masters of software development course. 

 ---  THE GAME  ---
Animated Bug World is a game where the user takes on the role of a spider trying to trap all the flies in webs whilst avoiding the ladybugs.

User controls:
w: UP
s: DOWN
a: LEFT
d: RIGHT
b: Create new web (only available when the web status bar is full)

Winning the game: catch all of the flies in webs
Losing the game: get caught by a ladybug

Other controls:
Pause
Restart
Play

New trees, laybugs and flies are automatically generated every few seconds.


--- THE PROJECT  ---
Uses JAVAFX to create the GUI
Uses inheritance for classes of things that exist in the 'world' - i.e. bugs and trees
